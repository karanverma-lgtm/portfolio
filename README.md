# Netflix-Style Portfolio — Karan Verma

A minimal, dark, Netflix-inspired portfolio to share with HR and recruiters.

Files:
- `index.html` — main portfolio (hero, carousels, skills)
- `resume.html` — printable resume
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/script.js` — content and small interactions

How to open:
- Double-click `index.html` in the `netflix-portfolio` folder, or
- Serve with a simple static server:

PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\91901\PycharmProjects\Resume Builder\netflix-portfolio"
python -m http.server 8000
# then open https://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps:
- Add your profile photo and custom project screenshots to the `assets/` folder.
- Hook up contact form or scheduling link.
- Convert to a single-page app and deploy to Netlify/Vercel.
